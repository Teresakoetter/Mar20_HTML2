<h2><a href="#spring">spring destinations</a></h2>
<p>We chose warmer locations, remembering the freezing experience of Elbsandsteingebirge when every night was a fight against the sleeplessness due to temperature.</p>
<h2><a href="#summer">summer destinations</a></h2>
<p>Summertime is outdoortime. As much as possible. Often smaller weekend trips, since the weather plays along, and we don't have to put millions of miles under our feet.So Europe it is. </p>

<h2><a href="#autumn">Autum destinations</a></h2>
<p>Mountains here we come. Traditionally one last high alpine hike before the snow wants to eat us alive.</p>
<h2><a href="#winter">Winter destination</a></h2>
<p>Either a hunt for snow, or long distance traveling.</p>
